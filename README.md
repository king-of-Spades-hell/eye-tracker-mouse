The Eye-Controlled Mouse enables hands-free control of a computer using eye movements and blinks. Utilizing a webcam, it tracks facial landmarks with OpenCV and MediaPipe, moving the cursor and detecting blinks for clicks via PyAutoGUI. This project enhances accessibility, offering a practical and intuitive alternative to traditional input devices.
